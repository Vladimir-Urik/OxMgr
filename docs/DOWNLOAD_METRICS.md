# Download Metrics

Live dashboard: https://vladimir-urik.github.io/OxMgr/downloads/

The dashboard is generated by [`.github/workflows/download-metrics.yml`](../.github/workflows/download-metrics.yml) and published to the same `gh-pages` branch already used for the APT repository.

## What it shows

- Exact GitHub release asset download counts
- Exact Chocolatey package-page download counts
- Homebrew analytics when a formula is available through the public Homebrew formula API
- Explicit blind spots for channels that cannot be measured exactly from the current hosting setup

## Important caveats

- GitHub release asset counts are file counts, not pure package-manager attribution. The Linux and macOS tarballs are shared by Homebrew installs, npm postinstall downloads, and manual downloads.
- The Windows zip is shared by Chocolatey installs, npm postinstall downloads, and manual downloads.
- The current APT repository is served from GitHub Pages, so exact APT download and install counts are not available in this dashboard.
- The current Homebrew installation path uses a custom tap. If `oxmgr` is not present in the public Homebrew formula API, the dashboard shows Homebrew as an indirect signal only.

## Refresh

- Scheduled daily by GitHub Actions
- Manually runnable from the `Download Metrics` workflow
